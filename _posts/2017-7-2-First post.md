Oh, no! 

Come on! 

Come on, baby. 

Grab it! 

All right. 

What...? 

Vincent. 

No, no, bad idea. Bad idea! 

Just take what you need. 

Just take what you need. 

What's...? 

RJ? 

No? 

The moon's not full. 

You woke me up a week early? 

Oh, no. 

Don't tell me you're dumb enough to actually try and steal my stuff. 

RJ, I'm gonna have to kill you. 

Please, I'm just a desperate guy trying to feed his family. 

- You don't have a family. - I meant a family of one. 

OK, wait, wait, wait, wait! Look, it's still in the cave. 

So, technically, not stolen. 

Oh, no! 

No! 

Slow! 

Stop! 

That was close. 

Vincent, wait! I can get it all back! 

That's right! If you eat me, you'd have to do it. 

But I can get it. All of it! 

- My red wagon? - Redder! 

- The blue cooler? - Blue cooler. On my list! 

- Gotta be blue? - Yes! 

And I want my Spuddies. I love those things. 

'Cause with a Spuddie, enough just isn't enough. 

So true. Painfully true. And I'll tell you what. 

I'm gonna get you the giant picnic pack, family-fun size. 

- They have that? - I'm pretty sure. 

All right, RJ. I'm going back to sleep. 

When that moon is full, I'm waking up. 

And all my stuff had better be right back where it was. 

But that's just one week! That's impossible for one guy! 

A week's perfect. I'll get some helpers. 

Full moon, all my stuff. And don't even think about running away. 

Because if you do, I will hunt you down and kill you. 

OK! OK, buddy! You just rest easy, all right, 'cause I'm on it. 

Hey, in a week from now, we're gonna be laughing about this thing.
